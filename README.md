# RFM-Analysis---Sales-Segmentation
customer segmentation and analyzing their behavior through RFM Analysis (Recency – Frequency – Monetary)


One of the primary goals of sales companies in general is to gain a deeper and more accurate understanding of their customers and strengthen the relationship between the customer and the company. This helps drive continuous growth and enhances the ability to market products to customers with precision and effectiveness.
One of the most important tools that can strengthen this relationship and provide a clear understanding is customer segmentation and analyzing their behaviour through what is known as RFM Analysis (Recency – Frequency – Monetary).
This is a model for customer segmentation and a tool that helps identify the most recent customers (when was the last time the customer made a purchase – Recency), the most frequent buyers (the number of purchases – Frequency), and the highest spenders (financially – Monetary).
By determining these factors (Recency – Frequency – Monetary), we can collect and classify customers into segments with meaningful labels, such as Champions, Loyal Customers, Big Spenders, At Risk, and so on.
Here comes the role of the data analyst in transforming raw data into high-quality, actionable insights. Based on this analysis, you can contribute to making strategic decisions targeting these customers, such as identifying products to promote, improving the company’s loyalty programs, reactivating inactive customers by targeting them with attractive offers, and enhancing the company’s resource management by focusing resources (time, budget, effort) on high-value customers.
